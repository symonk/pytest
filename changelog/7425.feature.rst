New :fixture:`pytester` fixture, which is identical to :fixture:`testdir` but its methods return :class:`pathlib.Path` when appropriate instead of ``py.path.local``.

This is part of the movement to use :class:`pathlib.Path` objects internally, in order to remove the dependency to ``py`` in the future.

Internally, the old :class:`Testdir` is now a thin wrapper around :class:`Pytester`, preserving the old interface.
